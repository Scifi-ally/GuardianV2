# Or run directly on connected device
npm run android:dev
```

#### iOS (macOS only)

```bash
# Open Xcode
npm run mobile:open:ios

# Or run directly on connected device/simulator
npm run ios:dev
```

## üîß Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Edit your code in `client/` directory
2. Run `npm run build:mobile` to rebuild
3. Use `npm run mobile:sync` for quick sync without full rebuild

### Available Scripts

- `npm run build:mobile` - Build web app and sync with mobile
- `npm run android:dev` - Build and run on Android
- `npm run ios:dev` - Build and run on iOS
- `npm run mobile:sync` - Sync changes to mobile platforms
- `npm run mobile:open:android` - Open Android Studio
- `npm run mobile:open:ios` - Open Xcode

## üìã Camera Permissions

The app automatically handles camera permissions:

### Android

- Camera permission for QR scanning
- External storage permission (if needed)

### iOS

- Camera usage permission
- Photo library access (if needed)

### Web Browser

- Camera access through getUserMedia API
- Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## üîç Features

### QR Scanner

- **Real-time scanning**: Live camera feed with QR detection
- **Mobile optimized**: Uses environment camera (back camera)
- **Visual feedback**: Scan region highlighting and code outline
- **Error handling**: Proper permission and error management
- **Cross-platform**: Works on web and native mobile

### Emergency Features

- Location-based safety scoring
- Emergency contact management
- Real-time route optimization
- Offline emergency functionality

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working

1. **Check permissions**: Ensure camera permissions are granted
2. **Restart app**: Close and reopen the application
3. **Check device**: Verify device has a working camera
4. **Browser issues**: Try different browser for web version

### Build Issues

1. **Clean build**: Delete `node_modules` and reinstall
2. **Capacitor sync**: Run `npm run mobile:sync`
3. **Native tools**: Ensure Android Studio/Xcode are properly installed

### Android Build Errors

1. Check Android SDK is installed
2. Verify JAVA_HOME environment variable
3. Open Android Studio and sync project

### iOS Build Errors (macOS)

1. Install CocoaPods: `sudo gem install cocoapods`
2. Run `pod install` in `ios/App` directory
3. Open Xcode and clean build folder
