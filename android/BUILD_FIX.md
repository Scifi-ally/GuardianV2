# 🔧 Build Fix Guide

## ✅ Material 3 Theme Issue Fixed

The build error was caused by Material 3 theme compatibility issues. Here's what I fixed:

### 🛠️ **Changes Made:**

1. **Simplified Theme:** Updated to use standard `Theme.Material3.DayNight`
2. **Updated Dependencies:** Latest Compose BOM for better compatibility
3. **Removed Complex Attributes:** Removed Material 3 attributes that may not be available

### 🚀 **Try Building Again:**

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### 🔧 **If Still Having Issues:**

#### Option 1: Use AppCompat Theme

If Material 3 still has issues, update `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<!-- Change this line in AndroidManifest.xml -->
android:theme="@style/Theme.Guardian.Fallback"
```

#### Option 2: Force Clean

```bash
# Delete build folders and try again
rm -rf .gradle/
rm -rf app/build/
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

#### Option 3: Check Android Studio

- File → Sync Project with Gradle Files
- Build → Clean Project
- Build → Rebuild Project

### 📱 **Alternative Quick Fix**

If you want to get running immediately, you can also:

1. Open Android Studio
2. File → Open → Select the `android` folder
3. Let Android Studio sync and fix dependencies
4. Click "Run" ▶️ button

The updated configuration should resolve all Material 3 theme issues! 🎯
