# ðŸ”¥ Nuclear Fix - Absolute Last Resort

The `colorSurface` error is deeply embedded. Here's the nuclear option:

## ðŸš€ **Option 1: Use Minimal Build File**

```bash
# Backup original build file
mv app/build.gradle.kts app/build.gradle.kts.backup

# Use minimal build file
mv app/build_minimal.gradle.kts app/build.gradle.kts

# Clean and build
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## ðŸš€ **Option 2: Try Android Studio (Most Likely to Work)**

1. **Open Android Studio**
2. **File â†’ Open** â†’ Select your `android` folder
3. **Wait for sync**
4. **Build â†’ Clean Project**
5. **Build â†’ Make Project**
6. **Run â†’ Run 'app'** (green play button)

Android Studio often handles these issues automatically.

## ðŸš€ **Option 3: Check Generated Files**

```bash
# Look for problematic generated theme files
find . -name "*.xml" -exec grep -l "colorSurface" {} \;

# Delete ALL generated files
rm -rf app/build/
rm -rf .gradle/
./gradlew clean
```

## ðŸš€ **Option 4: Create New Project**

If all else fails:

1. **Android Studio â†’ New Project**
2. **Empty Activity**
3. **Package: com.guardian.safety**
4. **Copy over just:**
   - `google-services.json`
   - `MinimalMainActivity.kt`
   - Basic Firebase dependencies

## ðŸŽ¯ **Root Cause:**

The `colorSurface` attribute is coming from a cached or generated file that references Material 3. Even though we removed all Material 3 dependencies, something is still pulling it in.

## ðŸš¨ **Emergency Backup Plan:**

If NOTHING works, I can create a completely new Android project structure from scratch that's guaranteed to work. Just let me know!

**Try Android Studio first - it's most likely to work! ðŸš€**
