## üó∫Ô∏è Enhanced Navigation with Safety Intelligence

### Comprehensive Safety Metrics

The system evaluates **11 critical safety factors** for each route:

1. **Overall Safety Score** (Weighted composite)
2. **Crime Rate** (20% weight) - Historical and real-time crime data
3. **News Incidents** (15% weight) - Recent safety incidents from news
4. **Traffic Safety** (15% weight) - Road conditions, traffic patterns
5. **Women's Safety** (10% weight) - Gender-specific safety concerns
6. **Time-based Risk** (10% weight) - Hour/day/seasonal risks
7. **Communal Tension** (5% weight) - Social harmony indicators
8. **Political Stability** (5% weight) - Protests, bandhs, elections
9. **Emergency Access** (8% weight) - Hospital/police proximity
10. **Infrastructure Quality** (7% weight) - Road condition, lighting
11. **Crowd Density** (3% weight) - Population density risks
12. **Lighting Conditions** (2% weight) - Street lighting quality

### Map Visualization Features

- **Route Coloring**: Each route segment colored by safety score

  - üü¢ Green (80-100): Very Safe
  - üü° Yellow (60-79): Moderately Safe
  - üü† Orange (40-59): Risky
  - üî¥ Red (20-39): High Risk

- **Incident Markers**: Real-time incident markers on map
  - Color-coded by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  - Clickable with detailed incident information
  - Time-stamped with recency indicators

### Indian-Specific Safety Considerations

#### Traffic Safety Analysis

- **Highway vs Local Roads**: Highways rated safer due to better maintenance
- **Ring Road Bonus**: Outer ring roads get safety boost
- **Village Road Penalty**: Old/village roads penalized heavily
- **Speed Analysis**: Traffic density based on average speed
- **Mode-specific Risks**:
  - Walking: Distance penalties for long routes
  - Cycling: Heavy penalty due to Indian traffic conditions
  - Driving: Rush hour and night driving risks

#### Time-based Risk Assessment

- **High Risk Hours**: 10 PM - 5 AM (40 point penalty)
- **Moderate Risk**: 6-9 PM (20 point penalty)
- **Rush Hour Risk**: 8-10 AM, 5-8 PM (15 point penalty)
- **Weekend Risks**: Sunday isolation, Saturday crowds
- **Festival Season**: Diwali/Holi season risk increases

#### Women's Safety Factors

- **Base Score**: 75/100 (acknowledging ground reality)
- **Time Multiplier**: Night hours get 2x risk weight
- **Transport Mode**: Walking alone heavily penalized
- **Area Assessment**: Market/crowded areas vs isolated zones

#### Crime Pattern Analysis

- **City-specific Base Rates**: Mumbai (0.7), Delhi (0.8), Bangalore (0.6)
- **Night Crime Amplification**: 15-point penalty for late hours
- **Location Integration**: Real-time news incident correlation
