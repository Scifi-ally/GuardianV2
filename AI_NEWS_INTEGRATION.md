# AI-Powered News Integration for Safety Scoring

This document explains how the enhanced safety area system uses artificial intelligence to analyze news data and provide real-time safety scoring.

## Overview

The safety system now integrates multiple data sources through AI analysis to provide comprehensive safety scoring:

1. **Base Safety Factors**: Time of day, population density, emergency services proximity
2. **News Analysis**: AI-powered analysis of local news, crime reports, traffic incidents
3. **Real-time Updates**: Continuous monitoring of news sources for safety-relevant events

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Enhanced Area Visualization

- **Seamless Coverage**: Hexagonal grid system with no gaps between areas
- **Score-based Shapes**: Area appearance changes based on safety score
  - Color intensity: Red (dangerous) → Orange → Yellow → Green (safe)
  - Opacity: Higher risk areas are more visible
  - Border thickness: Thicker borders for areas requiring attention
- **Smart Z-indexing**: Dangerous areas appear on top for visibility

### ✅ AI News Analysis

- **Multi-source Integration**: Analyzes multiple news sources simultaneously
- **Geospatial Weighting**: News impact decreases with distance from location
- **Temporal Decay**: Recent news has more impact than older reports
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Positive/negative/neutral classification of news
- **Relevance Scoring**: AI determines how relevant news is to safety

### ✅ Notification Management

- **Smart Suppression**: Bad area notifications are REMOVED instead of shown
- **Reason**: Prevents notification spam in dangerous areas which could:
  - Cause panic or stress
  - Drain battery with constant alerts
  - Reduce user trust in the system
- **Silent Monitoring**: System still tracks dangerous areas but doesn't alert

### ✅ Real-time Click Analysis

- **Instant Analysis**: Click any location for immediate AI safety assessment
- **Loading States**: Shows analysis progress with professional UX
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Displays base score + news impact + AI reasoning
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when news APIs are unavailable

## AI News Sources Integration

### Current Implementation

The system is designed to integrate with multiple news APIs:

```typescript
// News sources that can be integrated
private newsSources: NewsSource[] = [
  { name: "NewsAPI", url: "https://newsapi.org/v2/everything" },
  { name: "Local News RSS", url: "/api/local-news" },
  { name: "Police Reports API", url: "/api/police-reports" },
  { name: "Traffic API", url: "/api/traffic-incidents" },
  { name: "Weather Alerts", url: "/api/weather-alerts" },
];
```

### Available Integrations

1. **NewsAPI.org** - Global news aggregation
2. **Local Police RSS Feeds** - Crime reports and incidents
3. **Traffic Incident APIs** - Real-time traffic and accident data
4. **Weather Alert Systems** - Severe weather notifications
5. **Social Media Safety Reports** - Community-reported incidents

### Setup Instructions

To enable real news integration:

1. **Get API Keys**:

   ```bash
   # Add to your .env file
   VITE_NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
   VITE_POLICE_RSS_URL=local_police_feed_url
   VITE_TRAFFIC_API_KEY=traffic_api_key
   ```

2. **Configure Sources**:

   ```typescript
   // The system will automatically detect available APIs
   await newsAnalysisService.integrateRealNewsAPIs();
   ```

3. **Test Integration**:
   ```bash
   # Test news analysis endpoint
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/news-analysis \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"latitude": 37.7749, "longitude": -122.4194}'
   ```

## AI Analysis Process

### 1. Data Collection

- Fetches news within 5km radius of location
- Filters for safety-relevant content using NLP
- Categorizes by type: crime, traffic, weather, community

### 2. Relevance Analysis

```typescript
interface NewsAnalysis {
  safetyRelevance: number; // 0-100 how relevant to safety
  sentiment: "positive" | "neutral" | "negative";
  categories: string[]; // crime, traffic, weather, etc.
  confidence: number; // AI confidence in analysis
}
```

### 3. Scoring Algorithm

```typescript
finalScore = baseScore * 0.7 + newsScore * 0.3;

// Where:
// - baseScore: Traditional safety factors
// - newsScore: AI analysis of recent news
// - Weights can be adjusted based on data quality
```

### 4. Geospatial and Temporal Weighting

- **Distance Decay**: Impact decreases exponentially with distance
- **Time Decay**: Recent events have more weight than older ones
- **Source Reliability**: Trusted sources have higher weight

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy

- **30-minute cache**: News analysis results cached for performance
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple locations analyzed simultaneously
- **Progressive Loading**: Areas load in batches for smooth UX

### Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to base scoring if news APIs fail
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **User Feedback**: Clear loading states and error messages

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Integration

```typescript
import { EnhancedSafetyAreas } from '@/components/EnhancedSafetyAreas';

<EnhancedSafetyAreas
  map={map}
  userLocation={location}
  showSafeAreaCircles={true}
  onAreaUpdate={(areas) => console.log('Updated areas:', areas)}
/>
```

### 2. Manual News Analysis

```typescript
import { newsAnalysisService } from "@/services/newsAnalysisService";

const analysis = await newsAnalysisService.analyzeAreaSafety(lat, lng);
console.log("Safety score:", analysis.score);
console.log("Contributing factors:", analysis.factors);
```

### 3. API Integration

```bash
# Get news analysis for a location
POST /api/news-analysis
{
  "latitude": 37.7749,
  "longitude": -122.4194,
  "radius": 5
}

# Response
{
  "safetyScore": 78,
  "confidence": 87,
  "factors": ["✓ Community safety initiative...", "⚠ Traffic incident reported..."],
  "articles": [...],
  "lastUpdated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```
