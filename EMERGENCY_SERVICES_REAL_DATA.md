## üîç How It Works

```

```typescript
// Enhanced search with keywords and detailed results
const request = {
  location: new google.maps.LatLng(lat, lng),
  radius: radius,
  type: googlePlaceType,
  keyword: searchKeyword,
};
```

### 3. **Detailed Place Information**

```typescript
// Get full details for each place
const details = await this.getPlaceDetails(service, place.place_id);
```
