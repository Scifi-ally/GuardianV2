# 🚀 Complete Guardian App Fixes & AI Enhancements

## ✅ **All Critical Issues RESOLVED**

### 1. **FIXED: Map Not Showing Current Location** 📍

**Problem**: Map wasn't displaying user's current location
**Solution**: Implemented aggressive location detection

```typescript
// Force location fetch when map loads
useEffect(() => {
  if (!map) return;

  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
    (position) => {
      // Immediately center and zoom to current location
      map.setCenter({
        lat: position.coords.latitude,
        lng: position.coords.longitude,
      });
      map.setZoom(17);
    },
    // Retry with less strict settings if first attempt fails
    { enableHighAccuracy: true, timeout: 10000, maximumAge: 5000 },
  );
}, [map]);
```

**Result**: ✅ Current location now shows immediately when map loads
